        { "text": "Do a right 4-finger thrust at face level (3/4 extension, palm down). This is intended for longer range—3/4 extension means full reach without locking the elbow." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right 4-finger thrust at chest level (1/2 extension, palm in — hand tipped on its side). This is intended for mid-range—your elbow moves forward past your stomach, but not all the way out." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right 4-finger thrust at solar plexus level (1/4 extension, palm up, in an uppercut fashion). This is intended for in-close—your elbow does not move forward past your side." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right 4-finger thrust over your left shoulder, palm down." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Place your right hand on your left hand (left hand is still on your right shoulder); circle both hands down to the front and do double two-finger eye pokes at face level, palm up then palm down." },
        { "text": "Place your right elbow on the back of your left hand (arms level with your chest), fingers of your right hand facing away. Strike forward (moving from finger to elbow only) with your fingers in a whipping fashion toward the face." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Extend your right arm straight down, palm out. Place your left hand over the front of your right elbow and strike forward (moving from finger to elbow only) with a whipping motion toward the groin." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right inward, palm-up eye slice (right to left) followed by an outward, palm-down eye slice (left to right)." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right inward horizontal heel-palm at face level, followed by an in-place raking claw and draw your hand to your left shoulder. Follow with a right outward handsword at neck level." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right overhead/downward heel-palm claw at face level as your left hand does a rear upward heel-palm claw toward your back at groin level." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right underhand heel-palm claw at groin level as your left hand does a rear upward heel-palm claw toward your back at groin level." },
        { "text": "Repeat with left hand." },
        { "text": "Do a right underhand claw to the groin (do not move your left hand), then track both hands up to eye level and do double eye pokes with your thumbs." },
        { "text": "Pull your hands back to your hips and do a right two-finger eye hook." },
