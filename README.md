## 🥋 About the Project

**KenpoKicks** is a modern rebuild of a legacy martial arts website originally developed in the early 2000s. Created and maintained by Sifu Steve Hull, a 6th Degree Black Belt in Kenpo, this platform was built to preserve, teach, and share the principles, traditions, and culture of American Martial Training Systems Kenpo.

This rebuild honors the original mission of KenpoKicks: to provide clarity, inspiration, and connection to students and instructors across generations. The new architecture reflects a full-stack modernization of the site while keeping its heart rooted in the philosophy that shaped it.
